            <strong>Andrew Glover:</strong> “The community uptake has been tremendous! Having a platform that out-of-the-box accommodates multiple cloud providers and an extendable model to participate within, means that we are one large community rather than a bunch of micro-communities focused on various forks. This has the benefit that everyone within the community can take advantage of various innovations.”

            <strong>Andrew Philips:</strong> “Thanks to Spinnaker, developers can focus on developing business logic, rather than becoming experts on each cloud platform. Teams can track the lifecycle of a deployment using several notification mechanisms including email, Slack and SMS, allowing them to coordinate handoffs between developer and QA teams”.

            <strong>David Byron:</strong> “Spinnaker helped the team cut down the time and work needed for the versioning of ConfigMaps and secrets. That’s a pain to do other ways. Maybe it seems simple, but it’s a big deal for our team. The whole goal here is to not wake people up in the middle of the night. The rollback and no-downtime deployment features are things everybody wants to do. "The thing that Spinnaker promises is automated canary analysis. That to me is the holy grail to enabling continuous deployment.”

            <strong>Richard Genthner:</strong> “We originally envisioned transitioning toward Kubernetes on Google Cloud over three quarters. With Spinnaker’s open source flexibility, we completed the full migration in just 2.5 months!".

            <strong>Brandon Leach:</strong> “We knew our product had game-changing potential in the government sector, but our existing deployment framework was too human-intensive and time-consuming for FedRAMP compliance. Spinnaker provided the platform, support, and delivery pipeline we needed to bring our patch deployment times up to speed.”
